# Authentication

To allow ViveTube to fetch data from YouTube on your behalf, you'll need to authenticate it.

## Connecting Your YouTube Account

1.  After installing ViveTube, open a Google Sheet.
2.  Go to `Extensions` > `ViveTube â€“ YouTube Insights for Sheets` > `Open ViveTube Sidebar` (or a similar menu item like `Authorize Account`).
3.  The ViveTube sidebar will appear.
4.  Click on the "Connect YouTube Account" or "Authorize" button within the sidebar.
5.  You will be prompted to sign in with the Google Account that has access to the YouTube channel(s) you want to analyze.
6.  Grant ViveTube the necessary permissions to access your YouTube analytics data. These permissions are typically read-only and are required to fetch statistics.

## API Key (Optional - Advanced)

For certain advanced use cases or if you prefer to use your own YouTube Data API quota, ViveTube might offer an option to input your own API key.

- **Where to find this option:** (Describe if applicable, e.g., "In the ViveTube sidebar settings...")
- **How to generate a YouTube Data API Key:** (Link to Google's documentation or provide brief steps)

Once authenticated, you're ready to explore ViveTube's Features!
