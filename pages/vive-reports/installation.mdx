# Installation

Installing ViveReports is a quick and easy process. Follow the steps below to add it to your Google Sheets.

## Step 1: Go to the Google Workspace Marketplace

You can find ViveReports directly on the Google Workspace Marketplace.

## Step 3: Grant Permissions

Google will ask you to choose an account and grant permissions for the add-on to work. ViveReports requires these permissions to:
-   View and manage the spreadsheets that you use this add-on with.
-   Connect to your YouTube account (read-only access).
-   Run automatically to refresh your data.

Click **"Allow"** to complete the installation.

## Step 4: Find the Add-on in Google Sheets

After installation, open a Google Sheet (or refresh the page if you already have one open).

You can find ViveReports under the `Extensions` menu:

`Extensions` > `ViveReports: Track Video Performance` > `Open App`

If you don't see it immediately, wait a few minutes and refresh the page again.

## Troubleshooting

-   **I can't find the add-on:** Make sure you are logged into the same Google account you used for the installation.
-   **Installation is blocked:** If you are using a work or school account, your administrator may have disabled add-ons. Contact your IT department for assistance.

Next, you'll need to connect your YouTube account. See the [Authentication](./authentication) guide.
