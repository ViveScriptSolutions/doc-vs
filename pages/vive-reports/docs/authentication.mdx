# Authentication

To pull your private YouTube analytics data, you need to grant ViveReports secure, read-only access to your YouTube account. This process is handled through Google's secure OAuth2 system.

## How to Connect Your Account

1.  **Open the App:** From a Google Sheet, go to `Extensions` > `ViveReports: Track Video Performance` > `Open App`.
2.  **Click "Connect":** In the sidebar, click the **"Connect New YouTube Account"** button.
3.  **Choose Your Google Account:** A pop-up window will appear asking you to choose the Google account associated with your YouTube channel.
4.  **Grant Permissions:** Google will show you a list of permissions that ViveReports is requesting. These include:
    -   **View your YouTube Analytics reports:** To get video and channel performance data.
    -   **View your YouTube account:** To get basic information like channel names and video lists.
    -   **View your monetary data (optional):** Only if you choose to track revenue for monetized channels.
5.  **Confirmation:** After you click "Allow," the pop-up will close, and the sidebar will update to show your connected account.

## Managing Connected Accounts

You can connect multiple YouTube accounts to ViveReports.

-   **Adding another account:** Simply click the "Connect New YouTube Account" button again.
-   **Switching between accounts:** If you have multiple accounts connected, a dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select which one to use for adding new channels.
-   **Disconnecting an account:** To disconnect an account, go to the `Settings` tab in the add-on sidebar and click the "Disconnect" button next to the account name.

## Security

-   **Read-Only Access:** ViveReports only requests **read-only** permissions. It cannot change, delete, or upload anything to your YouTube account.
-   **Google's Security:** The entire authentication process is handled by Google. ViveReports never sees or stores your password.

Now that you're connected, you're ready to start using the [features](./features)!
