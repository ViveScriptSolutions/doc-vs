# Technical Details

This section provides a deeper look into the technical architecture of ViveReports.

## APIs Used

ViveReports is built on top of several Google and YouTube APIs:

-   **YouTube Data API v3:** Used to fetch public data about channels and videos, such as titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.
-   **YouTube Analytics API:** Used to retrieve private analytics data for authenticated users, including views, watch time, and audience demographics.
-   **Google Apps Script:** The entire add-on is written in Google Apps Script, which allows it to run natively within Google Sheets.

## Data Handling and Storage

-   **Data Storage:** All of your YouTube data is stored directly in your Google Sheet. ViveReports does not store your analytics data on any external servers.
-   **User Preferences:** User-specific settings, such as connected accounts and report configurations, are stored using Google's `PropertiesService`, which is scoped to your user account and the specific document.
-   **Subscription Status:** Your subscription status is verified by making a secure, server-to-server call to our backend, which communicates with Stripe.

## Security and OAuth Scopes

ViveReports uses the principle of least privilege, meaning it only requests the permissions it absolutely needs to function. Here is a list of the OAuth scopes it uses and why:

-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui`: To create the add-on's user interface (menus, sidebars).
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly`: To write data into the current spreadsheet.
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`: To identify you for subscription management.
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.scriptapp`: To create and manage automated data refresh triggers.
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.send_mail`: To send email reports (only if you enable the feature).
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`: To view basic information about your YouTube channels.
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics.readonly`: To view your YouTube Analytics reports.
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics-monetary.readonly`: To view revenue data (only if you enable it).
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request`: To communicate with the YouTube API and our subscription server.
-   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.locale`: To display dates and numbers in your local format.
