## Project Overview

ViveReports is a powerful Google Sheets add-on that connects directly to the YouTube API, allowing you to automate your YouTube analytics tracking.

## OAuth Scopes Justifications

Based on your provided code (`Code.js`, `UserPreferences.js`, `YouTubeService.js`, etc.), all the OAuth scopes currently listed in your `appsscript.json` appear to be necessary and well-justified:

- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui`**
  - **Justification:** Used to create the add-on's custom menu (`ðŸ“º ViveReports`) and display sidebars (`AppDashboard`, `ChannelInfo`, `SettingsSidebar`, `HelpSidebar`, `ReportSetup`) and modal dialogs (`SubscriptionPlans`) within the Google Sheets interface.
  - **Necessity:** Essential for any add-on that provides a user interface.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly`**
  - **Justification:** Used for most interactions with the active spreadsheet, such as reading configuration from the "Dashboard" sheet (e.g., date ranges), writing analytics data to channel-specific sheets, and managing the hidden "config" sheet for channel dropdowns.
  - **Necessity:** Required for the add-on to read from and write data to the spreadsheet it's installed in.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`**
  - **Justification:** Used by `Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()` to retrieve the user's email address. This is crucial for identifying the user for subscription status checks (`UserPreferences.checkAndUpdateSubscriptionStatus`), personalizing cache keys (`refreshNow`), and linking users to Stripe checkout sessions (`doGet`).
  - **Necessity:** Essential for user-specific features, especially subscription management.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.scriptapp`**
  - **Justification:** Used to programmatically create, manage, and delete time-driven triggers (`ScriptApp.newTrigger`, `ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers`, `ScriptApp.deleteTrigger`). This enables automated daily tasks like subscription checks (`getUserSubscription`), data synchronization (`refreshNow`), and email reports (`sendDailyReportEmail`).
  - **Necessity:** Required for any automation features that run on a schedule.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.send_mail`**
  - **Justification:** Used by `MailApp.sendEmail()` in the `sendDailyReportEmail` function to send automated performance summary emails to the user.
  - **Necessity:** Required for the automated email reporting feature.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`**
  - **Justification:** Used by `YouTubeService.js` to make calls to the YouTube Data API v3 for fetching public and user-authorized channel metadata (subscribers, views, video count, titles, descriptions), video details, and discovering channels associated with the user's account.
  - **Necessity:** Core to retrieving basic YouTube information.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics.readonly`**
  - **Justification:** Used by `YouTubeService.js` to query the YouTube Analytics API for non-monetary performance metrics (e.g., views, watch time, likes, comments, audience retention, demographics) for authorized channels.
  - **Necessity:** Essential for providing detailed analytics beyond basic metadata.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics-monetary.readonly`**
  - **Justification:** Used by `YouTubeService.js` to query the YouTube Analytics API specifically for monetary data like `estimatedRevenue` for authorized and monetized channels.
  - **Necessity:** Required if the add-on offers revenue tracking features. This is a sensitive scope and will require clear justification to Google.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request`**
  - **Justification:** Used by `UrlFetchApp.fetch()` to make HTTP requests to external services. This includes calls to Google APIs (YouTube Data, YouTube Analytics), your backend API at `vivescriptsolutions.com` for subscription checks and Stripe checkout initiation.
  - **Necessity:** Fundamental for any integration with external APIs.
- **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.locale`**
  - **Justification:** Used by `Session.getScriptTimeZone()` in conjunction with `Utilities.formatDate()` to ensure dates and times (e.g., "Last Update" timestamps, report dates, PDF filenames) are displayed and logged correctly according to the script's configured timezone.
  - **Necessity:** Important for correct date/time handling and presentation.

**Conclusion on OAuth Scopes:** Your current list of OAuth scopes is well-aligned with the functionalities demonstrated in your codebase. No scopes appear to be unnecessary at this stage.

## `urlFetchWhitelist` Justifications

The domains listed in your `urlFetchWhitelist` are also justified:

- **`https://www.googleapis.com/`**
  - **Justification:** Base domain for many Google APIs, including parts of the YouTube Data API v3 (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/...`).
  - **Necessity:** Required for direct calls to these Google API endpoints.
- **`https://youtube.googleapis.com/`**
  - **Justification:** While `youtubeanalytics.googleapis.com` is more specific for the Analytics API, this broader domain might cover other YouTube API subdomains or future needs.
  - **Necessity:** Covers YouTube API services.
- **`https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token`**
  - **Justification:** This is the Google OAuth2 token endpoint. The `OAuth2` library used by your add-on will make requests to this URL to exchange authorization codes for access tokens and to refresh tokens.
  - **Necessity:** Essential for the OAuth2 authentication flow.
- **`https://youtubeanalytics.googleapis.com/`**
  - **Justification:** The specific endpoint for the YouTube Analytics API, called by `YouTubeService.getChannelAnalyticsReport()`.
  - **Necessity:** Required for fetching detailed analytics data.
- **`https://www.vivescriptsolutions.com/`**
  - **Justification:** Your backend server domain. Used for API calls related to subscription checking (`Config.VIVESCRIPT_API.SUBSCRIPTION_CHECK_URL`) and initiating Stripe checkout (`Config.VIVESCRIPT_API.STRIPE_CHECKOUT_API_URL`) as seen in `UserPreferences.js` and `Code.js` (`doGet`). Also hosts your add-on's logo (`logoUrl` in `addOns.common`) and potentially other image assets displayed in your HTML sidebars (e.g., `HelpSidebar.html`).
  - **Necessity:** Required for communication with your custom backend services and for the add-on framework and HTML service to load these images.

**Conclusion on `urlFetchWhitelist`:** The `urlFetchWhitelist` is also correctly configured. The domains listed are actively used by your add-on for its core functionality, including authentication, API interactions, and backend communication.

## Setup and Installation (For Developers/Testers)

1.  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:**
    - Ensure you have a GCP project.
    - Enable the "YouTube Data API v3" and "YouTube Analytics API".
    - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID & Client Secret) for a "Web application".
      - **Authorized JavaScript origins:** `https://script.google.com`
      - **Authorized redirect URIs:** `https://script.google.com/macros/d/{SCRIPT_ID}/usercallback` (replace `{SCRIPT_ID}` with your Apps Script project's deployment ID).
2.  **Apps Script Project:**
    - Copy all the `.js` files and `appsscript.json` into your Apps Script project.
    - Add the `OAuth2` library:
      - Script ID: `1B7FSrk5Zi6L1rSxxTDgDEUsPzlukDsi4KGuTMorsTQHhGBzBkMun4iDF`
      - Identifier: `OAuth2`
    - **Script Properties:** Go to File > Project properties > Script properties and add:
      - `CLIENT_ID`: Your Client ID from GCP.
      - `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Client Secret from GCP.
      - `VIVESCRIPT_BACKEND_API_KEY_FOR_CHECKOUT`: Your backend API key for subscription/checkout.
3.  **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the script as a Web App (Deploy > New deployment):
      - Execute as: "Me (your.email@example.com)"
      - Who has access: "Anyone" (for the OAuth redirect URI).
    - Note the `SCRIPT_ID` from the web app URL to correctly form your redirect URI in GCP.
4.  **Testing:**
    - Open a Google Sheet.
    - The "ðŸ“º ViveReports" menu should appear (you might need to refresh or authorize the script for the current document first).
    - Use the "Channel Info" sidebar to initiate authorization.
