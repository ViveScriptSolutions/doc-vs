# Authentication

To allow ViveReports to fetch data from YouTube on your behalf, you'll need to authenticate it.

## Connecting Your YouTube Account

1.  After installing ViveReports, open a Google Sheet.
2.  Go to `Extensions` > `ViveReports: Track Video Performance` > `Open ViveReports Sidebar` (or a similar menu item like `Authorize Account`).
3.  The ViveReports sidebar will appear.
4.  Click on the "Connect YouTube Account" or "Authorize" button within the sidebar.
5.  You will be prompted to sign in with the Google Account that has access to the YouTube channel(s) you want to analyze.
6.  Grant ViveReports the necessary permissions to access your YouTube analytics data. These permissions are typically read-only and are required to fetch statistics.

## API Key (Optional - Advanced)

For certain advanced use cases or if you prefer to use your own YouTube Data API quota, ViveReports might offer an option to input your own API key.

- **Where to find this option:** (Describe if applicable, e.g., "In the ViveReports sidebar settings...")
- **How to generate a YouTube Data API Key:** (Link to Google's documentation or provide brief steps)

Once authenticated, you're ready to explore ViveReports's Features!
